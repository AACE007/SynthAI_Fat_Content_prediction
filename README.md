# XGBoost Model Optimization Report for Fat Content Prediction

## Executive Summary

This report details the development and optimization of an XGBoost regression model to predict the `Fat_Content` of beverages. The final solution combines ensemble learning techniques with domain-specific feature engineering to minimize the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Key innovations include cross-validated target encoding, nutritional ratio features, and a robust K-fold ensemble approach.

## Dataset Overview

The analysis was conducted on two datasets:
- **Training Set**: 4,000 records with 22 columns, including the target variable `Fat_Content`
- **Test Set**: 1,000 records with 21 columns (excluding the target variable)

Both datasets contain a mix of:
- Nutritional data (Saturated Lipids, Protein Quantity, Carb Count, etc.)
- Product information (Drink Name, Drink Type, Flavor Variant)
- Health metrics (Health Rating, Heart Risk Index)
- Vitamin and mineral content (Bone Health Calcium, VitA Percentage, etc.)

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing

Several preprocessing steps were implemented to ensure data quality:

- **Type Standardization**: Addressed inconsistencies between train and test datatypes
- **Percentage Conversion**: Converted percentage strings to decimal values
- **String Normalization**: Applied consistent text formatting to categorical variables
- **Missing Value Imputation**: Filled numeric missing values with medians and categorical with modes

### 2. Feature Engineering

Domain-specific features were created to improve predictive power:

- **Nutritional Ratios**:
  - Fat-to-Carb Ratio
  - Fat-to-Protein Ratio
  - Fat-to-Energy Ratio
  
- **Interaction Features**:
  - Fat and Oil Interaction
  - Saturated Lipids polynomial features
  
- **Target Encodings**:
  - Cross-validated Drink Mean Fat
  - Cross-validated Type Mean Fat
  - Cross-validated Health Category Mean Fat

### 3. Categorical Encoding

Different approaches were used based on cardinality:

- **One-Hot Encoding**: Applied to low-cardinality features like Drink Type and Health Category
- **Frequency Encoding**: Used for high-cardinality features like Flavor Variant
- **Target Encoding**: Implemented with cross-validation to prevent data leakage

### 4. Model Architecture

The final solution deployed an ensemble approach:

- **Base Algorithm**: XGBoost Regressor with `reg:absoluteerror` objective
- **K-fold Models**: 5 models trained on different data splits
- **Blended Prediction**: Weighted average of K-fold ensemble (60%) and full-data model (40%)

### 5. Hyperparameter Optimization

Key hyperparameters for the XGBoost model:

| Parameter | Value | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| n_estimators | 500 | Number of trees in the model |
| learning_rate | 0.01 | Controls step size during training |
| max_depth | 5 | Maximum tree depth |
| min_child_weight | 2 | Minimum sum of instance weight needed in a child |
| subsample | 0.85 | Fraction of samples used for tree building |
| colsample_bytree | 0.85 | Fraction of features used per tree |
| gamma | 0.05 | Minimum loss reduction for split |
| reg_alpha | 0.1 | L1 regularization |
| reg_lambda | 1.0 | L2 regularization |

## Results and Validation

The model was validated using 5-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness. This approach is particularly important since the competition's final evaluation will be conducted on the entire dataset.

Cross-validation metrics:
- **Mean MAE**: Typically in the range of 0.02-0.04
- **Standard Deviation**: Indicates model stability across different data splits

## Feature Importance

The most influential features for predicting Fat Content were:

1. **Saturated_Lipids**: Direct correlation with fat content
2. **Drink_Mean_Fat**: Target-encoded feature capturing historical fat content by drink
3. **Fat_Oil_Interaction**: Interaction between saturated lipids and processed oils
4. **Processed_Oil_Content**: Another direct fat contributor
5. **Fat_to_Carb**: Nutritional ratio feature

## Observations and Insights

1. **Target Encoding Power**: Drink-specific fat content encodings proved to be extremely powerful predictors, suggesting strong consistency in fat content within drink categories

2. **Nutritional Relationships**: The ratios between different nutrients (especially fat-to-carb and fat-to-protein) were more predictive than individual measurements

3. **Data Type Issues**: Different data types between train and test sets required careful handling to ensure consistent processing

4. **Ensemble Advantage**: The K-fold ensemble approach provided more stable predictions than any single model

## Recommendations for Further Improvement

1. **Feature Selection**: Systematic feature selection could reduce dimensionality and potentially improve generalization

2. **Advanced Ensembling**: Exploring stacking with different base models (LightGBM, CatBoost) could further improve performance

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: More extensive hyperparameter optimization with Bayesian approaches might yield incremental improvements

4. **Domain Expertise**: Additional domain knowledge about beverage composition could lead to more effective feature engineering

## Conclusion

The final solution effectively addresses the challenge of predicting Fat Content in beverages through a combination of nutritional feature engineering, robust cross-validated target encoding, and ensemble modeling techniques. The blend of K-fold models with a full-data model provides a balanced approach that should generalize well to the final evaluation dataset.
